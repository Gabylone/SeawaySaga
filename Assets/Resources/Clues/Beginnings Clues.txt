NOMTRESOR ? Some quarrelsome bandits roam the south-west with only this words in their mouths
Fishermen avoid the south-west because they avoid some marauders are ready to kill for the slightest piece of information about this legend
If someone knows something about a treasure in these calm and unthreatening seas, than it's probable it's a bunch of low-life bandits int the south-west
Isn't it the name some locals gave to the woods north-east of here ? Yes ! The forest of NOMTRESOR
Ah, I once met a man in the local tavern who swore his research on NOMTRESOR lead him to the woods, north-east of here. He passed out drunk that same night
Listen, if there is some kind of "secret hidden riches", it's surely in the north-east forests. It's the only place the locals don't know like the back on their hand
