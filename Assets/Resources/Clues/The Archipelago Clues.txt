I heard some imperial captain in a south western camp has been sinking every pirate ship*Looking for the treasure of NOMTRESOR.*Better have a clean record to approach 'em.
Some soldiers layed camp, north east of a huge village,*because their chief is obsessed with NOMTRESOR.*You won't miss it, they're surrounded by pirate ship wrecks.
Some friends of mine, coming from the south, dropped anchor on somekind of fortune teller's island.*They're usually sceptics but they kind of blew their mind.*Maybe they'll help you with NOMTRESOR.
In the south border of thoses seas,*it is said a prophet answers all kind of questions.*If you ask me, it's a scam.*You never know 'till you tried though...
Lately, everybody's been scraching their heads about that cave,*west of the north-west town.*I'm no treasure hunter, but that'd be my first guess for anything related to NOMTRESOR
NOMTRESOR ?*Isn't it somekind of ancient magic gibberish ?*I think it's idiotic, but the loonies and drunks who do pay attention to it*seem to speak only of a cavern, at the north western border.
In the bandit surrounded North Eastern Town,*there was a famous local drunk who only talked about it.*Nobody paid attention, but one day they took a ship, sailed west, and never came back.*They either died or are swimming in a pool of gold.
Last time I heard those words, I was sailing north east.*Passing an insignificant desert island, I heard a delirious vagrant standing there shouting something to me. Could only make out these words: “ NOMTRESOR ”.
Ah ! There's an inn near the south eastern border that carries this name.*I remember it well, because I was STARVING,*Not having dropped anchor for weeks.
I drank the finest ale in a tavern with that name.*It was north of the Village in the North West.*Or was it the Village in the South East...*I wish I could be more precise, but I was senselessly drunk.
