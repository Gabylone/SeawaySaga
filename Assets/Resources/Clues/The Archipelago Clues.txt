I heard some imperial captain in a south western camp has been sinking every pirate ship*Looking for the treasure of NOMTRESOR.*Better have a clean record to approach 'em.
Some soldiers layed camp, north east of a huge village,*because their chief is obsessed with NOMTRESOR.*You won't miss it, they're surrounded by pirate ship wrecks.
Some friends of mine, coming from the south, dropped anchor on somekind of fortune teller's island.*They're usually sceptics but he kind of blew their mind.*Maybe he'll help you with NOMTRESOR.
In the south border of thoses seas,*it is said a prophet answers all kind of questions.*If you ask me, it's a scam.*You never know 'till you tried though...
Lately, everybody's been scraching their heads about that cave,*west of the north-east town.*I'm no treasure hunter, but that'd be my first guess for anything related to NOMTRESOR
NOMTRESOR ?*Isn't it somekind of ancient magic gibberish ?*I think it's idiotic, but the loonies and drunks who do pay attention to it*seem to speak only of a cavern, at the north eastern border.
In the bandit surrounded North Eastern Town,*There's a memorable local drunk who talked only about it.*Nobody paid attention, but one day, he took a ship a sailed west*And never came back.*He either died or is swiming  in a pool of gold.
Last time I heard those words, I was sailing north east.*Passing a insignifiant desert island,a delirious hobbo was screamed his lungs out to my boat.*Most of what I could understand was "NOMTRESOR"
Ah ! There's an inn near the south eastern border that carries this name.*I remember it well, because I was STARVING,*Not having dropped anchor for weeks.
I drank the finest ale in a tavern with that name.*It was south of the Village in the North West.*Or was it the Village in the South East...*I wish I could be more precise, but I was senselessly drunk.
