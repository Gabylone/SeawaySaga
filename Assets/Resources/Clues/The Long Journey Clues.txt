You wouldn't believe the amount of unexperienced sailors who tried to cross the vast and empty ocean*with only the name of NOMTRESOR in their mouth.*Surely, at least one of the wrecks of those fools...*must contains valueable information.
If someone ever got hold of something rational and authentic about NOMTRESOR,*he probably sank, trying to cross the immense ocean,*right before arriving to the Town in the north
I heard about a man and his wife that build a house in the middle of the ocean.*About halfway between the Southern and Northern Village.*They built it there, in the middle of nowhere...*because they thought this was where the treasure was.*It's nothing but a legend, keep in mind.
There's a marchant vessel who goes back and forth...*Crossing the Empty Sea...*It is said he always takes a bit more food and supplies to an old woman's house,halfway in the trip.*He does this out of sympathy for the granny.*She's clearly lost her mind, only speaking nonsense about NOMTRESOR all day.
Well, you won't find any clue sailing randomly in thoses Empty Seas...*Towns and Villages are the places you should investigate.*Taverns and townsquares are a good guess, but you try and hit the CASINOS.*People there have heard and seen everything, and they're ready to gamble or bet anything,*Stories and informations included.
The "Heard about NOMTRESOR ?" people are tramps, nutcases, drunks or pirates.*Like you !*Sometime or another, they all end up wasted, sorrowfull and bitter*in the dark corners of a casino.*Gambling away the last coins they have.*And I know this, for I have seen it.
