Listen, Einstein.*Don't you think the Labyrinth everybody seems to be talking about has something to do with it ?*Go South East, and leave people alone with those bread-and-butter fables.
The South Eastern Labyrinth has been around for ages and ages.*It's surrounded by mysterious caves and enigmatic caverns.*I don't see anywhere else in those oceans you could get answers from NOMTRESOR.
Don't get too far away from the Labyrinth if you're interested in those children stories.*I bet every answers about NOMTRESOR is less than a day away from the Labyrinth island,*South East from here.
Those who pursue the treausre go to the Labyrinth island, in the South Eastern border.*I'd warn you, though, none got back from this wild-goose chase.
