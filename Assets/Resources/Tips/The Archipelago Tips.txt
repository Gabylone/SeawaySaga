Here, every damn island is sooo far away from another.*Any crew would have to be prepared as hell before doing any trip.
They call this ocean "the Archipelago",*and it takes a good captain and a good boat to sail them.
They say there's a port in every corner of this ocean,*whatever that means.
Apart from a few shipwreck and bandits,*you won't find a lot in between the islands.
To find this treasure might take you to restart your journey a few times.
The only captains like you who survived around here know this ocean like the back of their hand.
Some say a village in the north west is the pretty quiet.*Which means you won't get in a lot of trouble getting there.
A friend of mine is a boat carpenter.*He lives not very far south of the North West village.
Straight west is a bunch of military camps.*You want weapons and men, that's where you head.
The South West Village is hidden behind a crazy load of forests.*you never know want you might find in them.
The South East Village is a far from everything, and not as developped as the others.*Better than the one in the North, though.
North of the South East Village is a bunch of shops that sell non any sort of non sense.*You lack anything, you go there.
A day of sailing north of the South East Village, and you get your crew's bellies full for the year !*The food there is abundant!
There's a crazy amount of islands, east of The Archipelago,*but I heard they're all covered in trees, and basically unvisited.
Be careful if you go North East.*The Village there is surrounded by bandits and crooks.*Very few return.
West of the South West Village is just a collection of empty islands.*Every sailor who goes there are disapointed.
Oh you wanna a fix your boat, to carry more loot and crew ?*I know a good carpenter, he's based near the south western village.
Oh you wanna a fix your boat, to carry more loot and crew ?*I know a good carpenter, he's based near the nort eastern village.
Oh you wanna a fix your boat, to carry more loot and crew ?*I know a good carpenter, in the nort-western part of those seas.*He's kinda lost in the middle of nowhere.*Between a handful of desert island.
Oh you wanna a fix your boat, to carry more loot and crew ?*I know a good carpenter, somewhere in the south.*He's surrounded by wrecks.*Maybe sailors who didn't get to him in time.
