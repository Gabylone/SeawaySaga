Apart from a few bandits, you won't find a lot of threats around here
Take it easy around here, this ocean is made for newbie captains like you !
This ocean is pretty small to explore. You'll see most of it really quickly
I once met an inexperienced treasure hunter just like you. Said he found something in a forest and died the same day of food poisoning.
If someone knows something about a treasure in these calm and unthreatening seas, than it's probable it's a bunch of low-life bandits on a secluded island.
