You want to go north ?*Your're about to cross a very long ocean, buddy.*Gear up before setting sail !
I don't get people leaving north...*They've got everything around here.*A town, woods, food and military protection.
When the animation of the Town brings me down, I go either east or west of it.*A walk in these huge woods do the trick.
You've got everything if the South Town.*You need something, you'll sure find it there.
You look like another one crazy captain planning to sail north.*Before leaving, do me a favor and buy something to eat, south west of the town.
If you down have enough men to make the try north,*the military camps in the south west might help you.
You might stumble upon a few shipwrecked sailors along you journey.*I'm sure they'll want a place aboard your ship, and you'll want some company.
Last I check, they are only shipwrecks and deserted islands in the immense ocean between the North and South.*However, rumors have it a small tavern, surrounded by nice woods, serve loony voyagers.*Don't miss it.
In the South Town bandits dens, we hear talk of a small tavern, helping travellers cross the ocean.*You ask me, I say that's non sense.*Who would start a business there.
If you cross the ocean, which I doubt, yoy don't have to worry about food anymore.*The North Town feed you, cloth you.*And tell you all about that treasure you're probably looking for.
Say hi to the innkeeper in the North Town for me.*It's not because the longest ocean separates us, that we have to be rude to one another.
It's a pretty woody region around here.*If you find an island in the ocean, it's probably gonna be cover in pines.
Oh you wanna a fix your boat, to carry more loot and crew ?*I bet there's a carpenter in both the North and South Village.
Oh you wanna a fix your boat, to carry more loot and crew ?*I bet there's a carpenter in both the North and South Village.
I wish I knew how to swim,*so I could see what lies in the ocean’s depths!
I saw a mermaid the other day...*I must say the thing was as ugly as a sick dog, with its two long tusks.*Dreadful sight.
My dad used to tell me about the legend of the great pirate Bobby*who sailed this very ocean a long time ago.
My mom’s got two peglegs,*so when she walks she goes « clippety-clop » haha!
Ah, I wouldn’t sail too far if I were you.*A gigantic beast has been swallowing whole ships!*Nah I’m joking, you’ll be fine.
Don’t make my mistake,*never cut your toenails next to the soup bowl.
I like to fart in bed but it wakes up my wife.*And my neighbors.
Rat cheese.*Not the best idea I had.
Have you heard that screaming snail?*I’m not the only one am I?
Don’t forget to stay hydrated, and never drink sea water!*No matter how thirsty you are!
My dog went missing a few days ago.*But it came back one morning, holding a big bone in its mouth!*I wonder if it’s from a dead person.
It’s always good to see a new face around here!*Just be careful if you don’t want to end up at the bottom of the sea.
The other day I saw a madman building an entire ship using only driftwood!*Before he set sail, he told me it took 6 years to find all the materials on the beach.*I never saw him again.
I went for a walk this morning and I kept feeling a slight pain in my right foot.*I stopped and removed my boot only to find a big spider inside. It was biting my toes this whole time!
Someone kept stealing gold coins from my stash recently*so I buried it in my backyard.*Now the problem is that I buried it too well and I can’t find it anymore!
When you get a cold and your throat is a bit itchy,*add a spoonful of honey to a big mug of rum.*It has a nice soothing effect, puts me to sleep instantly!
Lost all my money at that gambling house one night.*So I tried to regain everything by betting my kid,*and I lost.*Lucky for me that boy is smart and he found his way back home the next day!
I found an old sword stuck in an abandoned pier one day.*It was hard but I managed to pull it!*The blade was all glowing and humming so I put it right back.*It’s funny I can’t remember where it was!
I was cleaning my pistol the other day when it went off out of nowhere!*So I went to ask my neighbor for his gun oil to polish my pistol*Strangely, he wasn’t responding.
When I was a kid, my Pa and I went fishing one day.*The sea was quiet, and I spotted something into the water.*It was a beautiful mermaid!*By the time I turned around to show him, my Pa already jumped off the boat and disappeared into the depths,*never to be seen again.*Curse you mermaid!
My mom used to make the tastiest and juiciest parrot drumsticks,*until we stopped eating these birds and started treating them as pets.*I love my parrot,*but I really miss those drumsticks!
One day my brother and I were coming back from the market,*when he found a four-leaf clover.*The instant he picked it, a strange man ran to us*He shoved a bag in my brother’s arms before disappearing in the bushes.*It was full of gold, at least a hundred nuggets!*With all this we helped people in every way we could,*and the clover eventually crumbled to dust.
My uncle’s dream was to be able to fly like a bird.*In less than a year,  he managed to catch and attach close to a hundred seagulls to a chair.*But when he scared them off to lift him up, he only got covered in guano!
Have you ever heard of that person eating toenails soup?*Some people in this world are complete lunatics if you ask me!
I bought some very bad cheese from a merchant one day.*They said it was a new kind of milk, cheap but very nutritious,*but they didn’t want to tell me from which animal.*Now that I think about it they had a few rats in cages behind them…
The other day I was in my house reading a book*When a bullet suddenly came right through the pages!*It came from my neighbor’s house, I knew they wanted me dead!*Then I heard knocking at my door...*it was probably them, coming to finish me off...*So I didn’t respond, and I’m still hiding from them to this day!
They all joke about a giant ship eating beast, but it’s true!*I was pair trawling with another boat when I saw it coming out of the sea, as big as a house!*It took away half of my friend’s ship in one bite.*I managed to drag him out of the water before it came back to swallow the remains of his boat.*I’ll never forget those yellow eyes!
There is a legend of an ancient magic sword, stuck in a pier somewhere.*Many try to claim the blade, but only the chosen one is able to pull it out,*becoming the most powerful warrior of the seas!*But like I said, this is just a legend.
You think you’re a good fighter but you haven’t met my grandma!*She was born and raised in the Archipelago,*and at 17 she went to see the Labyrinth by herself!*Killed so many pirates that she collected enough gold teeth to make herself a new sword pommel.*Now she’s 89 but she still sails around and even brings us back gold teeth sometimes!*She says sailing reminds her of my grandpa Bobby,*I never knew him but he seemed like a great sailor.
This damn cat and the seagulls kept eating fish from my market stand.*So I managed to come to an arrangement with the cat:*it keeps the seagulls away and I give him the small fish.*Now my fish stand is always full and we’re both happy!
When me and my brother were on the way to visit our grandma to the east,*our boat entered a thick fog.*It was midday with the clearest sky, but we couldn’t see 10 foot away.*Then, we saw the water around the boat start to bubble and steam, like it was boiling…*And we heard moaning from further away in the fog…*Without warning, our boat was pushed away out of the fog by a big wave,*as if something gigantic had risen from the depths of the ocean!*We just sailed back here as fast as we could, and now I’m sticking to letters to get news from my grandma…
