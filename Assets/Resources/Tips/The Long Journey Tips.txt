You want to go north ? Your're about to cross a very long ocean, buddy. Gear up before setting sail !
I don't get people leaving north... They've got everything around here. A town, woods, food and military protection.
When the animation of the Town brings me down, I go either east or west of it. A walk in these huge woods do the trick.
You've got everything if the South Town. You need something, you'll sure find it there.
You look like another one crazy captain planning to sail north. Before leaving, do me a favor and buy something to eat, south west of the town.
If you down have enough men to make the try north, the military camps in the south west might help you.
You might stumble upon a few shipwrecked sailors along you journey. I'm sure they'll want a place aboard your ship, and you'll want some company.
Last I check, they are only shipwrecks and deserted islands in the immense ocean between the North and South. However, rumors have it a small tavern, surrounded by nice woods, serve loony voyagers. Don't miss it.
In the South Town bandits dens, we hear talk of a small tavern, helping travellers cross the ocean. You ask me, I say that's non sense. Who would start a business there.
If you cross the ocean, which I doubt, yoy don't have to worry about food anymore. The North Town feed you, cloth you. And tell you all about that treasure you're probably looking for.
Say hi to the innkeeper in the North Town for me. It's not because the longest ocean separates us, that we have to be rude to one another.
It's a pretty woody region around here. If you find an island in the ocean, it's probably gonna be cover in pines.
